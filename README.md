# 🧬 Endo-ML: Machine Learning for Endometriosis Biomarker Discovery

A multimodal bioinformatics and machine learning project for identifying biomarkers and predicting endometriosis status using RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data.

---

## 🚀 Overview & Motivation

Endometriosis is an under-researched gynecological disorder affecting an estimated 5–10 % of women.  
Current diagnostics are invasive and often delayed.  
This project applies **bioinformatics and ML techniques** to support **non-invasive diagnosis** and **molecular understanding** of endometriosis.

It demonstrates:
- Differential gene expression analysis (RNA-Seq)
- Differential methylation analysis (e.g., MBD-Seq)
- Multi-omics integration
- Supervised ML models for disease prediction
- Feature selection and biological interpretation (GO / pathway enrichment)

Together, this showcases strong competence in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and biological reasoning**.
